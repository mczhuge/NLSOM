## ‚ú® Introduction
We introduce the **Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind (NLSOM)** concept, which contains societies and communities of agents.

#### üî• News: 
- [Dylan R. Ashley](https://dylanashley.io) will give a presentation of NLSOM in [NeurIPS RO-FoMo](https://sites.google.com/view/r0-fomo/accepted-papers?authuser=0) workshop. See our [poster](https://metauto.ai/images/nlsom-v9.pdf).
- [This position paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17066.pdf) marks the beginning. Our vision continues to unfold and grow stronger!  
- **We finished this repo in early May but was released 7 months later**. 

#### 1. Concepts:
- Agents can be either LLMs, NN-based experts, APIs and role-players. They all communicate in natural language.
- To solve tasks, these agents use a collaborative "Mindstorm" process involving mutual interviews.
- Additional components for NLSOM can be easily added in a modular way.

             <li><b> Concepts of NLSOMs:</b> Both Minsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúSociety of Mind‚Äù and Schmidhuber‚Äôs ‚ÄúLearning to Think‚Äù inspire diverse societies of large multimodal neural networks (NNs) that solve problems by interviewing each other in a ‚ÄúMindstorm.‚Äù Recent implementations of NN-based societies of minds consist of large language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through a natural language interface. In doing so, they overcome the limitations of single LLMs, improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning. In these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), new agents‚Äîall communicating through the same universal symbolic language‚Äîare easily added in a modular fashion. </li>
         </ul>
     </p>        
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Process:</b>   In this GitHub project, 1) our first step is to recommend relevant communities and agents aligned with the users' goals. These recommendations encompass tools, plugins, models, and role-players, which can then be loaded accordingly. 2) Additionally, we employ a Mindstorm approach, setting ourselves apart from previous models like VisualChatGPT and HuggingGPT, which solely rely on a single model for a specific function. Within our framework, a community of agents shares a common function, such as "search", while each agent possesses unique strengths and capabilities. For instance, agents like "Bing Search," "Wikipedia," "arXiv," and "WolframAlpha" collaborate to provide a more comprehensive understanding. 3) Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of reward mechanisms. In our current implementation, we reward different models for their contributions to task completion, which serves as a valuable means of evaluating a model's usefulness for specific tasks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>     
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Outlook:</b>   The concept behind this project is to provide a preliminary NLSOM solution. To illustrate, let's consider a scenario where a non-technical individual lacks expertise in computer science and has limited knowledge about various AI plugins. In such cases, the NLSOM system can automatically recommend different communities and agents to automate tasks based on user input in natural language. Even without understanding the performance of a specific model, the user can benefit from multiple models with the same functionality working together to offer more comprehensive answers. These AI communities can collaborate and compete with each other. Furthermore, the NLSOM system implements a reward mechanism that grants AI models a higher status based on their performance. This reward mechanism serves the purpose of optimizing the end-to-end recommendation/Mindstorm process in the future. It establishes a system akin to a Darwinian meritocracy within the AI community, where models compete and succeed based on their demonstrated excellence.

#### 2. About this repo:
This project is the **technical extension** for the original [NLSOM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17066.pdf), including:

- **üß∞ Recommendation**: Autonomously select communities and agents to form a self-organized NLSOM for solving the specified task.
- **üß† Mindstorm**: Multiple agents (models or APIs) can collaborate to solve tasks together more efficiently.
- **üí∞ Reward**: Rewards are given to all agents involved.

#### 3. Features:
- [x] Manage Easily: Simply change the template to organize your NLSOM in different areas.
- [x] Easy to extend: customize your own community and agents (Now we have 16 communities and 34 agents, see [society](https://github.com/mczhuge/NLSOM/tree/main/society)). 
- [x] Reward Design: provide a reward mechanism (albeit rough). You can easily upgrade to a more refined version. 
- [x] Elegant UI: has an interface and support for diverse file sources (image, text, audio, video, etc).

easily accessible and up-to-date collection of references for the emerging field of AGI safety. A significant number of safety problems for AGI have been identified. We list these, and survey recent research on solving them. We also cover works on how best to think of AGI from the limited knowledge we have today, predictions for when AGI will first be created, and what will happen after its creation. Finally, we review the current public policy on AGI.

Summary: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence is the hypothesis that substantial progress in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could result in human extinction or some other unrecoverable global catastrophe.The existential risk ("x-risk") school argues as follows: The human species currently dominates other species because the human brain has some distinctive capabilities that other animals lack. If AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "superintelligent", then it could become difficult or impossible for humans to control. Just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.The probability of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science...

Furthermore, I believe that the element of surprise is also essential, as it allows us to catch the enemy off guard and capitalize on any weaknesses they may have. With the right strategies and strategies in place, I am confident that we can achieve victory against Cao Cao.

            <li><b>üü° LiuBei:</b> If I were to find myself in the Three Kingdoms period, the most effective approach to defeat Cao Cao would be to combine the strength of my loyal officers, the wisdom of my advisers, and the courage of my people. I believe in the power of unity and dedication, which will bring us together as one and give us the strength to defeat any obstacle that stands in our way. With this approach, I believe that we can defeat Cao Cao and bring justice to our people.

            <li><b>üîµ ZhugeLiang:</b> In order to defeat Cao Cao, I would rely on the same strategies that I used to great success during the Three Kingdoms period. I would use a combination of tactical warfare, psychological warfare, and political maneuvering. By making use of my intelligence and strategic acumen, I could outmaneuver and outsmart Cao Cao, slowly whittling away at his forces until I had achieved an ultimate victory. My intelligence is unparalleled, and I am confident that I could successfully defeat Cao Cao and any other enemies that may arise.

            <li><b>üü§ ZhangFei:</b>  In order to defeat Cao Cao, I would use a combination of strategy and guile. My strategy would involve outwitting Cao Cao by using clever tactics such as forming alliances with other warlords, employing spies and informants to gather information about Cao Cao's plans, and making use of geographical advantages to gain an upper hand in battles. I would also seek to use Cao Cao's own ambition and pride against him, exploiting any weaknesses that could be used to my advantage. Ultimately, the key to victory lies in cleverly utilizing my resources and knowledge to outsmart Cao Cao and outmaneuver him on the battlefield.

The organizational structure of the NLSOM was effective in providing a comprehensive solution to the user-defined objective. The agents provided different perspectives and strategies to defeat Cao Cao, which were then combined to form a comprehensive solution.

            <li><b>‚ö™Ô∏è NLSOM System (Summary):</b>  The most effective approach to defeat Cao Cao in the Three Kingdoms period is to combine the strength of GuanYu, LiuBei, ZhugeLiang, and ZhangFei. GuanYu suggested using both military and diplomatic tactics, LiuBei suggested using the power of unity and dedication, ZhugeLiang suggested using tactical warfare, psychological warfare, and political maneuvering, and ZhangFei suggested using strength, courage, intelligence, and the loyalty of followers. By combining these strategies, Cao Cao can be defeated.

## ‚òëÔ∏è  TODO?
We adopt two ways to conduct NLSOM and Mindstorm: 

**v1.0:** üìã Preliminary Experiments: In the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17066.pdf), NLSOM and Mindstorm is driven by hardcodes. 

**v2.0:** üìã In this version, NLSOM is self-organized, and Mindstorm happens automatically.

**v3.0:** üéØ Future Work: 1) introducing RL; 2) Economy of Minds; 3) Self-Improvement; etc.
