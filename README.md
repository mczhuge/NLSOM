We are the multimodal team at the KAUST AI Initiative, led by Prof. [J√ºrgen Schmidhuber](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gLnCTgIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).


## ‚ú® Introduction

This project is the **technical extenstion** for original [NLSOM paper](): allowing you to build a specific NLSOM quickly. 
When you provide the inputs (files or targets), LLM automates all these processes for you:

- **üß∞ Recommendation**: Autonomously select communities and agents to form a self-organized NLSOM for solving the target.
- **üß† Mindstorm**: Empower with the automated mindstorm. Multiple agents (models or APIs) can effortlessly collaborate to solve tasks together.
- **üí∞ Reward**: Rewards are given to all agents involved.

Features:
- [x] Rule your NLSOM: effortlessly organize an NLSOM in various fields by simply changing the template.
- [x] Easy to extend: customise your own community and agents (now we have 17 communities and 32 agents). 
- [x] Reward Design: provide a reward mechanism (albeit rough). You can easily upgrade to a more refined version.
- [x] An elegant UI: facilitate better visualization and support for diverse media sources (image, text, audio, video, docs, pdf, etc).


## üí°Ô∏è Important Concepts

- We introduce the concepts NLSOM, which contains society, community and agent.
- Agents will collaborate to solve the task, we called it Mindstorm. 
- J√ºrgen also proposed the Economy of minds (EOM, sec 3 in paper), but we have yet to implement it.

    </p>   
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>‚ö™Ô∏è NLSOM System (Self-Organization):</b> We load the recommended AI communities with their their corresponding agents: (a) GuanYu, (b) LiuBei, (c) ZhugeLiang, (d) ZhangFei

        </ul>
    </p>     
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>üü¢ GuanYu:</b> To defeat Cao Cao, I would use my strategic acumen and superior martial prowess to lead an army of loyal followers to take a decisive victory. My strength and courage are unparalleled, and I have never been known to back down from a challenge. With my inspired leadership and unwavering commitment to justice, we can bring Cao Cao to justice and restore peace and stability to the Three Kingdoms.
    </li>
        </ul>
    </p>  
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>üü° LiuBei:</b> The most effective approach to defeat Cao Cao in the Three Kingdoms period is to employ a combination of tactical strategies. Firstly, I would use my political prowess to unify the other warlords and form an alliance that would be strong enough to oppose Cao Cao. Secondly, I would take advantage of my highly organized military tactics and strategies to effectively weaken Cao Cao's army. Finally, I would ensure that my own troops are well fed and well-armed, and that they maintain morale. By combining these tactical measures, I am confident that I can defeat Cao Cao and ultimately bring peace to the Three Kingdoms period.
    </li>
        </ul>
    </p>   
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>üîµ ZhugeLiang:</b>  My approach to defeating Cao Cao would be to outwit him through the use of strategy and cunning. I believe that the ability to outthink and outsmart your enemies is more powerful than any physical force. I have honed my skills in the art of war and I have a deep understanding of the dynamics of the Three Kingdoms period. I would use this knowledge to my advantage and create a strategy that would take Cao Cao by surprise. I would use guerilla tactics to surprise him and break his momentum. I would also use deception to mislead him and cause confusion. Ultimately, I believe that the key to victory is the combination of strategy, intelligence, and courage.
    </li>

    </p> 
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>üü§ ZhangFei:</b>  In order to defeat Cao Cao, I would use a combination of strategy and guile. My strategy would involve outwitting Cao Cao by using clever tactics such as forming alliances with other warlords, employing spies and informants to gather information about Cao Cao's plans, and making use of geographical advantages to gain an upper hand in battles. I would also seek to use Cao Cao's own ambition and pride against him, exploiting any weaknesses that could be used to my advantage. Ultimately, the key to victory lies in cleverly utilizing my resources and knowledge to outsmart Cao Cao and outmaneuver him on the battlefield.

Through strategic alliances and careful coordination within our own forces, we can utilize our strengths to overcome the enemy and ensure victory.

I believe in the power of unity and dedication, which will bring us together as one and give us the strength to defeat any obstacle that stands in our way. With this approach, I believe that we can defeat Cao Cao and bring justice to our people.

By making use of my intelligence and strategic acumen, I could outmaneuver and outsmart Cao Cao, slowly whittling away at his forces until I had achieved an ultimate victory.

* Change the Huggingface/Modelscope save path (Not neccessary but useful)

```bash
>>> import transformers
>>> print(transformers.__file__)
# Get the path: {YOUR_ANACONDA_PATH}/envs/nlsom/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/__init__.py
```

Open the ``{YOUR_ANACONDA_PATH}/envs/nlsom/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/utils/hub.py`` and change the line:
```
torch_cache_home = os.getenv("TORCH_HOME", os.path.join(os.getenv("XDG_CACHE_HOME", "{YOUR_NLSOM_PATH}/checkpoints"), "torch"))
hf_cache_home = os.path.expanduser(
   os.getenv("HF_HOME", os.path.join(os.getenv("XDG_CACHE_HOME", "{YOUR_NLSOM_PATH}/checkpoints"), "huggingface"))
)
```

Similarily, change the checkpoints saving place of modelscope,

```bash
>>> import modelscope
>>> print(modelscope.__file__)
# Get the path: ${YOUR_ANACONDA_PATH}/envs/nlsom/lib/python3.8/site-packages/modelscope/__init__.py
```

Open ``{YOUR_ANACONDA_PATH}/envs/nlsom/lib/python3.8/site-packages/modelscope/utils/file_utils.py`` and change the line:
```
default_cache_dir = Path.home().joinpath('{YOUR_NLSOM_PATH}/checkpoints', 'modelscope')
```

```
streamlit run app.py
```




#### 2. Run
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

```
